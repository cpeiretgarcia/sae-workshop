# Introduction to Small Area Estimation

## Why do we need Small Area Estimation?

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}

- Sometimes, as researchers, we want to generate estimates at very specific georgaphical levels.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
- Imagine you are a researcher trying to understand mobility behaviours for a specific neighbourhood.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
- You have access to individual data from a national travel survey, but not for that neighbourhood.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
- This is a common issue: surveys often do not sample enough people in our are of interest to produce reliable estimates.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
- This is where Small Area Estimation comes in -- it helps us *borrow strength* from other data to fill in these gaps.

## The advantages of SAE

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   **Overcome data limitations at local levels**. Traditional surveys often lack large-enough samples to produce reliable statistics at local levels. SAE methods allow to make statistically valid estimates even in areas with limited or no survey data.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   **Support evidence-based policy-making at local level**. Govenrments and institutions increasingly require local-level data to allocate resources more effectively. SAE can help in gathering the evidence required for planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress on key indicators at the scale where interventions happen.
:::

## What is SAE?

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   Small Area Estimation is a statistical modelling technique that uses **survey data** and **auxiliary information** (e.g. census data, administrative data, satellite imagery) to produce estimates of variables of interest at more granular level for the **domains** of interest.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 80%;"}
-   SAE methods produce "new" statistics that were not available before, at higher levels of **accuracy** than **direct estimates** generated through surveys.
:::

## Some concepts

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Survey data**: information collected from a sample of individuals through their responses to questions.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Sample**: smaller selection or subset of a larger group called population. The sample should be representative of the full population.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Population**: full group we are interested in (e.g., all people in a country).
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Small area** (or **domain**): small geographical area or spatial population unit for which reliable statistics cannot be produced due to limitations in the available data.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Estimator**: rule or formula to approximate unknown population parameters (e.g. sample mean, poverty rates).
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 65%;"}
-   **Accuracy**: distance between the statistical estimates and the "correct" values. It includes random errors (unpredictable and due to chance e.g. stopwatch), and systematic errors (consistent and repeatable e.g. biased scale)
:::

## SAE techniques

-   There are many SAE techniques -- the choice will depend on the **availability of auxiliary data** and the **relationship** between these data and the variable of interest.

# Direct estimation methods

## A brief note on survey sampling

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Sample surveys are cost-effective methods for obtaining information about wide-ranging topics at frequent intervals over time.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Surveys provide reliable estimators for areas where the sample size is large (large domains). These estimators can rely solely on area information and still be trust-worthy. These types of estimators are called ***direct estimators**.*
:::

## Direct estimation methods

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Also known as **design-based methods**, they rely **exclusively** on **domain-level** data.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   These estimators only work when the available sample is **large enough** to cover all domains of interest with **sufficient data** in each area. If a domain is not included in the sample, no estimates are produced for that domain.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   **What if there is data, but it is scarce?** The estimates produced by design-based methods will be unreliable due to large errors.
:::

## The Horvitz-Thompson estimator

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   It is used to estimate totals or means in a population from a probability sample.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   It accounts for the unequal probability of inclusion in the sample.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   The H-T estimator for the mean of area $d$ is:

$$
\hat{\bar{Y_d}} = \frac{1}{N_d} \sum_{i \in s_d} w_{di}Y_{di}
$$
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   where $w_{id}$ is the reciprocal of the inclusion probabilities for observation $i$ in subarea $d$.

$$
w_{id} = \frac{1}{\pi_{di}}
$$
:::

## H-T properties

::: {.fragment .fade-in style="font-size: 70%;"}
-   Thanks to the inclusion of weights, the H-T estimator is **design-unbiased** for the total of area $d$. This means that, on average, across all possible samples, the estimate is correct.

# Model-based methods -- The statistical approach



## Explicit modelling techniques

- They use models that link the small area estimates with auxiliary information.
- Thye increase the estimator's accuracy when direct estimation is not possible.
- They allow for incorporating information from multiple data sources.

## Area-level models

- These models use **area-specific auxiliary data** to project small area total estimates.
- The most commonly used one is the Fay-Herriot model.
- **Best use cases** -- Data is aggregated at area level (e.g. regional income estimates).
- **Data requirements** -- Survey data for small areas + Auxiliary data from census or other administrative records.

## Unit-level models

- These models use **unit-specific data** (e.g. individuals or households).
